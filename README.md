# airbnb-clone-project
Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Backend

A robust, scalable backend for an Airbnb-style platform. It powers secure user accounts, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and performance optimizations. The backend exposes both REST and GraphQL APIs, is documented with OpenAPI, and is production-ready with CI/CD, Docker, and monitoring hooks.


---
 Objectives

User Management: Secure registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

Booking System: Reserve properties, manage booking details, prevent double-bookings.

Payment Processing: Process and record booking payments.

Review System: Post and manage property reviews and ratings.

Data Optimization: Indexing, caching, and background jobs for fast, reliable performance.

üß∞ Technology Stack

Explain what each tech does in this project.

Django: Python web framework used for core business logic, ORM, admin, and app structure.

Django REST Framework (DRF): Builds RESTful APIs (serialization, viewsets, permissions, throttling).

GraphQL (Graphene/Strawberry): Flexible data fetching for clients that need tailored queries and fewer round-trips.

PostgreSQL: Primary relational database for transactional data and constraints.

Redis: Caching layer (per-request caching, computed lists), background task broker, and rate limiting.

Celery: Asynchronous task processing (emails, notifications, payment confirmations, thumbnails).

Docker & Docker Compose: Containerized local dev and reproducible deployments.

OpenAPI (Swagger/DRF Spectacular): Machine-readable API specification and interactive docs.

CI/CD (GitHub Actions): Automated testing, linting, building, and deployment pipelines.

Object Storage (S3-compatible): Store property images and media assets.



---

üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

Apps/Modules: users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, common (utils), api (routers), graphql.

APIs: REST (primary) + GraphQL (optional) + webhooks (payments).

Storage: PostgreSQL for relational data; S3 for images; Redis for cache and tasks.

Security: JWT or cookie-based auth, role-based permissions (guest/host/admin), input validation, rate limits.



---

üìö API Documentation

OpenAPI/Swagger UI: Interactive REST docs at /api/docs (dev) generated from DRF schemas.

GraphQL Playground: Interactive GraphQL at /graphql (if enabled).

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Team Roles

Brief descriptions of roles and responsibilities within this project.

Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, domain logic, serializers, permissions; writes unit/integration tests; maintains code quality and performance.

Database Administrator (DBA): Designs schemas, relationships, indexes, and query plans; manages backup/restore, migration strategy, and performance tuning.

DevOps Engineer: Owns infrastructure as code, Docker images, CI/CD workflows, observability (logs/metrics/traces), scaling, and secure secrets management.

QA Engineer: Plans and executes test strategies (API tests, E2E flows, regression), ensures non-functional requirements (performance, security) are met.

Product Owner/BA (optional): Prioritizes features, defines acceptance criteria, coordinates stakeholder feedback, and ensures business value delivery.

UI/UX Designer (optional): Provides API-informed designs, error states, and flows that drive API requirements and consistency.

üß± Database Design

Key entities and relationships (simplified):

User

Fields: id, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, role, created_at.

Relationships: One-to-many with Property (as host), one-to-many with Booking, one-to-many with Review.


Property

Fields: id, host_id (fk User), title, description, address, city, country, latitude, longitude, price_per_night, currency, max_guests, images, amenities, avg_rating, review_count, created_at.

Relationships: Many Booking, many Review, belongs to User (host).


Booking

Fields: id, user_id (fk User), property_id (fk Property), check_in, check_out, guests, status, total_amount, currency, payment_id, created_at.

Relationships: Belongs to User and Property; one-to-one with Payment.


Payment

Fields: id, booking_id (unique fk Booking), provider, provider_ref, amount, currency, status, created_at.

Relationships: Belongs to Booking.


Review

Fields: id, property_id (fk Property), user_id (fk User), rating (1..5), comment, created_at.

Relationships: Belongs to Property and User.



Relationships Summary

A User (host) can have many Properties.

A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking belongs to one User and one Property, and links to one Payment.

A Review is written by a User for a Property (typically one per stay).

üß© Feature Breakdown

1) User Management

Secure signup/login with hashed passwords (Argon2/bcrypt), session/JWT authentication, and profile updates. Role-based permissions (guest, host, admin) protect privileged operations.

2) Property Management

Hosts can create and manage listings with images, amenities, geolocation, and pricing. Includes search, filters (city, price range, amenities), and pagination for efficient browsing.

3) Booking System

Creates bookings with overlap prevention and status transitions (PENDING ‚Üí CONFIRMED ‚Üí CANCELED). Supports quoting, total calculation, and user/host visibility into booking history.

4) Payment Processing

Integrates with payment providers (e.g., Stripe, M‚ÄëPesa) to create/confirm payment intents and handle webhooks. Payment status updates the associated booking to ensure consistency and auditability.

5) Review System

Guests who completed stays can leave ratings and comments. Ratings are aggregated on properties (avg_rating, review_count) for fast sorting and display.

6) Data Optimization

Composite indexes on hot filters (e.g., (city, price_per_night), (property_id, check_in)), query selectivity, and caching (Redis). Long-running work handled by Celery; media stored on S3 + CDN.

üîê API Security

Authentication: JWT or secure cookie sessions; protects endpoints and identifies users.

Authorization (RBAC): Enforce roles (guest/host/admin) and ownership checks (e.g., hosts manage only their properties). Prevents unauthorized access or changes.

Input Validation & Sanitization: DRF serializers and validators guard against malformed data and injection.

Transport Security: HTTPS/TLS, HSTS, and secure cookie flags to protect data in transit.

Rate Limiting & Throttling: DRF throttles/Redis-backed rate limits mitigate brute-force and abuse.

Webhook Verification: Validate signatures (e.g., Stripe) and ensure idempotency for safe payment updates.

Secrets Management: Store credentials via environment variables or secret managers, never in code.

Logging & Audit Trails: Record auth events, data changes, and payment actions for incident response.



---

üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration: On PRs, run linters (flake8, black), type checks (mypy), unit/integration tests (pytest + dockerized Postgres/Redis), and security scans (bandit, pip-audit).

Continuous Delivery/Deployment: Build Docker images, push to registry, run migrations, and deploy to the chosen environment (e.g., Fly.io, Render, AWS, GCP, Azure, or VPS).

Why: CI/CD shortens feedback loops, raises quality, and enables reliable, frequent releases.
